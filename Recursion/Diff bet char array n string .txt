A string array is an array of strings , that is it stores address of a string at every index value , but a character array is an array of characters and hence will store a character at every index value .
For example :
You can store the names of five different people at five different array index locations in a string array of size 5 , but in a character array you will be able to store 5 characters at 5 different array index values.

a string array is a collection of strings.
a char array is a collection of characters.
eg.String str[]={"friend","life"};
String str1[]={"i","am","f"};
are correct declarations.
char ch[]={'f','i','r','e'}; is also correct.
but char ch[]={'friend'}; or
char char ch[]={"friend"}; are wrong declarations.
